# Classes & Object Oriented Programming (OOP)

A class is like a representation of an entire object

A class is defined as :

```Python
class Robot():
    # some code here
    # some other code here

    def talk(self):
        # some code here
        # another code here

 a = Robot()
 a.talk()
```
